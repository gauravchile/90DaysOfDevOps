#Introduction and Concepts

## Overview

Docker is a platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers ensure consistency across different computing environments and streamline DevOps workflows.

## Virtualization vs Containerization

| Aspect         | Virtualization          | Containerization                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Architecture   | Each VM runs its own OS | Containers share the host OS kernel |
| Resource Usage | High                    | Low                                 |
| Speed          | Slower startup          | Fast startup                        |
| Portability    | Limited                 | Highly portable                     |
| Isolation      | Hardware-level          | Process-level                       |

## Benefits of Containerization

* Faster deployment and scalability
* Lightweight and resource-efficient
* Consistent environment from development to production
* Simplifies CI/CD pipelines

### What I Know

* Basic difference between containers and virtual machines.

### What I Learned

* Why containerization is preferred for DevOps workflows.
* How Docker streamlines the software development lifecycle.
