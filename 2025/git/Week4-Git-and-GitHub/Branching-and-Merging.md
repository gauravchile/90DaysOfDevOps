# 2. Branching and Merging

## What I Learned
- Branching allows isolated development without affecting the main codebase.
- Merging integrates work from multiple branches into one.
- Pull Requests (PRs) enable collaborative reviews before merging.

---

## Key Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git branch <name>` | Create a new branch |
| `git switch <name>` | Switch to a branch |
| `git checkout -b <name>` | Create and switch to a branch |
| `git merge <branch>` | Merge branch into current branch |
| `git log --oneline --graph` | View commit history visually |

---

## Notes
- Branches support parallel feature or bug development.
- Merge conflicts occur when two branches modify the same line.
- Always pull the latest changes before merging.

---

## Reflection
Learned to manage multiple development lines efficiently.  
Understood merge conflicts and practiced resolving them safely.
