# 1. Git Basics

## What I Learned
- Git tracks changes in files and enables collaboration.
- Core commands: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `clone`, and `push`.
- GitHub serves as the remote for synchronization and sharing.

## Key Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git init` | Initialize a new repository |
| `git add <file>` | Stage files for commit |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Save staged changes with a message |
| `git status` | Show current working state |
| `git clone <url>` | Clone a remote repository |
| `git push origin main` | Push commits to remote branch |
| `git pull origin main` | Pull updates from remote |

---

## Notes
- Each commit represents a version snapshot.
- Use meaningful commit messages for traceability.
- PAT and SSH authentication make pushing secure.

---

## Reflection
Understood Git’s role in version tracking and remote collaboration.  
Learned to manage repositories efficiently using both HTTPS and SSH authentication.
