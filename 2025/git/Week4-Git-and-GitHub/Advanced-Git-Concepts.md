# 4. Advanced Git Concepts

## What I Learned
- Advanced Git features enhance collaboration and maintain clean histories.
- `cherry-pick` applies specific commits across branches.
- `rebase` replays commits for linear history.

---

## Key Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git cherry-pick <commit>` | Apply a specific commit to current branch |
| `git rebase origin/main` | Rebase current branch with main branch |
| `git diff` | Show changes between commits |
| `git reflog` | View full history including resets |

---

## Notes
- `rebase` keeps history clean; `merge` preserves branch context.
- Cherry-picking is useful for selective bug fixes.
- Always rebase locally, never on shared branches.

---

## Reflection
Learned professional Git operations for real DevOps workflows.  
Practiced rebasing and cherry-picking to maintain clean, traceable history.
