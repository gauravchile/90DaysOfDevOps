# 5. Branching Strategies

## What I Learned
- Different workflows suit different DevOps environments.
- Teams use structured branching for feature isolation and CI/CD pipelines.

## Common Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Suitable For |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Git Flow** | Uses feature, release, and hotfix branches | Enterprise DevOps |
| **GitHub Flow** | Simple model using main + feature branches | Small/medium teams |
| **Trunk-Based Development** | Frequent commits to main branch | Continuous Deployment |

---

## Notes
- Git Flow enables structured release management.  
- GitHub Flow is lightweight for continuous delivery.  
- Trunk-based minimizes merge conflicts for agile teams.

## Reflection
Understood how branching strategies align with team workflows.  
Helps choose the right model based on project size and release cycle.
